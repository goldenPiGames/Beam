The only things you actually need for the game are the index.html and the src folder.

make_kong.sh makes a folder called makeKong that contains the index.html and zippy.zip files for uploading to Kongregate. This version uses the Kongregate API, and it also trims out the unnecessary songs to fit into Kongregate's 150KB upload limit.

make_ng.sh makes a folder called submitNG that contains zippy.zip, which has everthing needed by the game.

metadata_and_stuff contains thumbnails, banners, screenshts, and similar. None of these are actually used by the game, they are just for displaying on a website.
